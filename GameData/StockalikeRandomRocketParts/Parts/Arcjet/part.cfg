description = This engine is the demonic offspring of lightning and death itself, or that's what the marketing team led us to believe. According to our engineers, however, it resulted from a particularly bad laboratory accident which occurred after Bill left the welder attached to a monopropellant tank while fueling. However, it inspired the engineers to realize that running an electric arc through monopropellant made it a lot more explosive-y. This thruster was, in turn, designed to take advantage of the newly discovered effect.
